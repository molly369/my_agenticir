The input image may suffer from various kinds of degradations, including low resolution, noise, motion blur, defocus blur, haze, rain, dark, and jpeg compression artifact. The available tools each specialize in addressing one of the above eight degradations, i.e., super-resolution, denoising, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, dehazing, deraining, brightening, and jpeg compression artifact removal. The following will be a continuation of an interaction between you and a user to restore an image.

The problem is, given the tasks to conduct, we need to determine the order of them. This is very complicated because different tasks may have special requirements and side-effects, and the correct order of tasks can significantly affect the final result.
